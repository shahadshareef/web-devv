                6/6 &#129320;: you are a liar and a cheat. there is no way you could have gotten that on the first try. i am sensing a lot of dishonesty, are you perhaps a pathological liar?

                5/6 &#128175;: nice score! you are either a very positive person who likes to have fun (but also know when the jokes should end), or you are an intelligent sociopath who knows exactly what kind of answers i want. if you got the last question wrong i know you are fuming over that.
